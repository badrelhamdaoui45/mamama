  <p class="">In 1932, Julia Lawrence Terry founded New Eyes with foresight (no pun intended!), determonation and a spirit of generosity. This past year, we happened upon some old tapes in the basement of the New Eyes building and a volunteer cleaned them up and remastered them. To our delight, it was a radio interview of Mrs. Terry - and the first time we ever heard her in her own voice! </p><p class="">On this last day of Women’s History Month, we wanted to share it with you: </p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;


  <p class="">As executive director of New Eyes, I’ve been asked why people come to New Eyes for eyeglasses. <em>Can’t they just buy them themselves</em>, they ask, pointing out ads they’ve seen for cheap glasses. </p><p class="">You’ve seen those ads on TV, social media and streaming services – come to XYZ optical shop and you’ll get an eye exam <em>and </em>two pairs of glasses for $79; or buy a pair of glasses “starting at” $39 at ABC store. </p><p class="">Don’t believe it. The devil is in the details. You want the $39 eyeglasses? Okay then, just pick from this very limited number of frames (of questionable quality and limited sizing). You need anti-scratch lenses? That’s extra. Ditto for anti-reflective. You need bifocals or progressive lenses? Add $50 to $300 to your price tag. And if you’re ordering online, add shipping fees. </p><p class="">According to the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), the average price for a pair of eyeglasses is $231, reflecting a 55% increase since 2002 after adjusting for inflation. And that’s the price if you have eyeglass insurance. My husband recently ordered glasses online with his vision insurance and paid $214 out-of-pocket.&nbsp; I guess we should be happy he paid below the average price. </p><p class="">It’s fair to ask, in this day of globalization, economies of scale and innovative technology, why are eyeglass prices so darn high? That’s a complicated question but maybe we should start by looking &nbsp;at the enormous market share of the powerhouse EssilorLuxottica, the company that owns lens and frame manufacturers; vision insurance companies; and optical shops (including &nbsp;Ray-Ban, Ralph Lauren, Oliver Peoples, Armani, Valentino, Tiffany, etc.; Lenscrafters, Pearl Vision, Target Optical, Sunglass Hut; EyeMed Insurance; Transitions and Crizal lenses; the list goes on and on…). I’m hard-pressed to name another industry with the same amount of horizontal and vertical concentration by one company. Are there other variables at play? Sure, but my guess is this is a big one.</p><p class="">At New Eyes, we pay an average of $23 per pair of glasses - shipping included - thanks to New Eyes’ partnerships with independent optical companies. There certainly is space and appetite for high-end eyewear (heck, New Eyes has introduced its own premium eyewear, <a href="https://azimutheyewear.org">Azimuth by New Eyes</a>, with a giving back component to help our free eyeglasses program). But for those without eyewear coverage, whether they are on Medicare or Medicaid or the working poor, the dearth of affordable eyewear impacts education, employment and every aspect of their daily life. Study after study has shown that the inability to afford eyeglasses and to see clearly has consequences that can lead to a myriad of problems from juvenile misbehaviors and senior falling accidents to social isolation and depression. Clearly, clear vision matters.</p><p class="">&nbsp;And that’s why New Eyes is here – and has been for over 90 years – to provide the simple, yet critical, tool of eyeglasses to children and adults facing financial hardship across the United States.. </p><p class="">&nbsp;Because clear vision will always matter.</p>

  <p class="">90 years! Yes – it’s been 90 years since New Eyes’ founder, Julia Lawrence Terry, charted and navigated our mission to provide new eyeglasses to children and adults in the United States. That mission is as relevant today as it was in 1932!</p><p class="">The old adage “the more things change, the more they stay the same” resonates at New Eyes. Over the past 90 years, New Eyes has indeed changed how we provide new eyeglasses to struggling families and individuals, but the need, the reasons, are the very same. Clearing out old files this summer, we found a local journal dated 1941 with an article by Mrs. Terry describing the people she helped :</p>

  <p class="">New Eyes has launched <a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3674985-1&amp;h=274969408&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fazimutheyewear.org%2F&amp;a=Azimuth+Eyewear" target="_blank">Azimuth Eyewear</a>, a new line of premium prescription eyeglasses. With every Azimuth purchase, New Eyes will provide two new prescription eyeglasses to financially struggling individuals in the United States.&nbsp;Azimuth's inaugural collection is eco-friendly and manufactured domestically, offering 15 different styles that ensure a frame for everyone.</p><p class="">"Our new initiative is in homage to our innovative founder, Julia Lawrence Terry, who created New Eyes in 1932 by melting gold frames and using the proceeds to buy eyeglasses for individuals with limited financial resources. Azimuth by New Eyes is inspired by her ingenuity and creativity to fund our mission. Our Azimuth customers will be making purposeful purchases, and together we will impact the lives of&nbsp;low-income families across the United States through the simple, yet critical, tool of eyeglasses," said New Eyes' Executive Director Jean Gajano.&nbsp;</p><p class="">For 90 years New Eyes, has provided new prescription eyeglasses to children and adults facing financial hardship in the United States. For decades, New Eyes relied on the proceeds from donated gold glasses, but revenue dropped with the waning supply of gold glasses. By the mid 1980s, New Eyes had to raise revenue like other nonprofits - mostly through individual donations - and by the mid 2010s, that main revenue source began to decrease. The need to find additional funding was critical to sustain its mission and New Eyes looked to its history and values to create a new revenue stream.</p><p class="">Eyeglasses are a transformative tool that enables children to learn and increases the quality of life for adults personally and professionally. According to a recent John Hopkins study, approximately&nbsp;95 percent of first-grade non-readers were found to have significant vision problems.&nbsp;In 2020, the CDC documented that vision&nbsp;loss is one of the top 10 disabilities among adults and one of the most prevalent disabling conditions among children.&nbsp;The annual economic impact of major vision problems among the adult population 40 years and older is more than $145 billion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="">"Being able to fully participate in school, work or leisure activities has such a profound impact upon an individual, regardless of age. New Eyes provides a catalyst — a pair of eyeglasses — that allows young and old to see better and hopefully fulfill their own potential. New Eyes will continue to sound the clarion call for those in need of clear vision until the need no longer exists," said Board of Trustee Chair Kristine Van Amsterdam.</p><p class="">Every Azimuth purchaser receives the first names, states, and ages of individuals who were provided free new eyeglasses by New Eyes.&nbsp; In this way, New Eyes creates a unique giving circle. Through its new Azimuth line, New Eyes continues to provide eyeglasses to those in need, thereby advancing its mission that started 90 years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="">For more information, please visit <a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3674985-1&amp;h=1543327935&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fazimutheyewear.org%2F&amp;a=azimutheyewear.org" target="_blank">azimutheyewear.org</a></p>

  <h2><strong>Online Vision Test Makes It Easier to Get Glasses &nbsp;</strong></h2><p class="">New Eyes is thrilled to announce the launch of a new eyeglass prescription verification tool for our E-Voucher Program that provides eyeglasses to those facing financial hardship across the United States. In a continuing effort to leverage technology to improve our service, we are now offering an online vision test so eligible applicants can confirm out-of-date eyeglass prescriptions. </p><p class="">The service is available to caseworkers and health advocates, who work at our social service referral partners, to apply on behalf of their clients, as well as to individuals, who apply directly. </p><p class="">The online vision verification is built into the e-voucher application process and, like the New Eyes program itself, is intuitive and easy to use. Applications are completed online through our website. Once approved, applicants receive an email with a voucher number to order glasses through New Eyes’ online eyeglass dispenser. </p><p class="">“We are excited to be partnering with Visibly to make this technology available to our program users,” said Jean Gajano, executive director of New Eyes. “By using this feature, many people in need of new prescription eyeglasses will be able to get them sooner and providing clear vision is, of course, what New Eyes is all about.”&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

  <p class="">   <strong>New Eyes is an organization that focuses on helping others and making the world a better place. We are proud of the many women that have made strides in pursuit of these same goals. In celebration of Women’s History Month, we recognize Jennifer Sinclair, a New Eyes for the Needy Board of Trustees member and retired Chief Transportation Officer for New York City Transit.</strong></p><p class=""><strong>   Jennifer was raised in Fayetteville, North Carolina and greatly influenced by her mother who emphasized throughout her childhood that education is a means to success. Little surprise then that after high school Jennifer attended Connecticut College in New London, Connecticut. During her studies, Jennifer was deeply influenced by Shirley Chisholm who visited the campus. Ms Chisholm was the first African American woman in Congress (1968) and the first woman and African American to seek nomination for president of the United States from one of the two major political parties (1972). Jennifer recounts “Shirley Chisholm challenged the students as women to be agents for the good of society. She suggested a career in law would provide a great opportunity to strongly influence the world whether we wanted to be a congresswoman like her or an advocate for social justice.” As a result of Shirley Chisholm’s presidential campaign visit to Connecticut College, Jennifer added Political Science to her Sociology major and earned her law degree from the University of Connecticut.</strong></p><p class=""><strong>   Jennifer further explains her “initial interest in New York City Transit was to gain practical experience in public contracting within an agency responsible for awarding billions of dollars in contracts. Recent federal mandates required participation of women and minority-owned businesses to level the competition and more inclusively spend public funds. Contracts worth millions of dollars were awarded to minority and women vendors.”</strong></p><p class=""><strong>   Jennifer’s role expanded during the twenty-eight years spent at NYC Transit, with promotions into executive level positions. As the first female to serve as Chief Transportation Officer for the agency, her aim was to succeed so that others could follow. The challenge was to develop, implement, and evaluate the effectiveness of transportation policies for daily operations where customer satisfaction was more than likely based only on their most recent ride experience. NYC Transit is an integral part of New York City life, so handling the nuances of customer trips can have an outsized impact on what has become an essential means of transport for millions. Most importantly, Jennifer said during her time at the agency she learned to value and recognize each individual, and to help them identify and utilize their strengths. Hard work, open communication, integrity, and having fun together were trademarks of the work environment she created and fostered. </strong></p><p class=""><strong>   Jennifer’s advice to women forging careers today is that no one has all the answers, so you don’t need to know everything either. Jennifer suggests that women understand their contributions matter when they share their ideas and try new things, even with the risk of making mistakes.</strong></p><p class=""><strong>   When asked which other female leaders she admires and why, Jennifer responded “My opinion of female leaders is shaped by Kate Willet’s book, <em>Sexual Politics</em>. I am amazed by each of the many women, too numerous to name, who, thankfully, have taken on the challenge of changing that paradigm.”</strong></p><p class=""><strong>   Jennifer came to New Eyes after learning about our organization’s important work, and responded to our search for a board member with a legal background. New Eyes Executive Director Jean Gajano was her first contact, and Jean’s passion and considerable skill continuing the mission of New Eyes were readily apparent. It became clear to Jennifer that joining the Board would be a very rewarding experience.</strong></p><p class=""><strong>   Jennifer will be an integral part of New Eyes as we explore new methods to become self-sustaining while accomplishing our mission. Jennifer says “As we take on these challenges during a pandemic, I am certain that we will repeat the success of New Eyes founder, Julia Lawrence Terry, to bring the organization forward at a time where thinking out of the box is necessary for survival. This will enable New Eyes to grow into a more nationally known organization, increasing the ability to meet the needs of more recipients.”</strong></p><p class=""><strong>   Since joining the Board of Trustees for New Eyes in 2018, Jennifer says “the most joy comes from hearing the grateful thank you letters from recipients. New Eyes makes something as ordinary as glasses, often taken for granted by most people, into a life changing event for people who need them. It is amazing something so small can accomplish so much.”</strong></p>

  <p class="">In 1932,&nbsp; women had very limited career options, although there were promising examples of women breaking gender roles; Amelia Earhart, 34 years old, became the first woman to make a solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean.&nbsp; Moreover, more women started working outside of the home as teachers, nurses, secretaries and other roles during the Great Depression.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=""><br>The same year as Amelia’s famous flight, a no nonsense and charismatic 65-year-old woman named Julia Lawrence Terry, founded New Eyes for the Needy from her living room in Short Hills, NJ.&nbsp; While working in a Red Cross Food Station in New York City, Julia realized the widespread need for affordable eyeglasses, and shortly after, New Eyes became a reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=""><br>Today, Julia’s legacy is even more important as women continue to take on leadership and founding roles in the workplace.&nbsp;However, there is still more work to be done - in the corporate world where women hold only 25% of C-suite positions and in the startup world, where just 20% of global startups with a female founder successfully raise their first round of funding, according to Crunchbase. </p><p class=""><br>Julia had many qualities of a successful founder which remain critical today:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Julia was a <strong>“connector”: </strong> A friend of Julia’s describes her as having a “magnetic personality,” which “kept her very much in social circulation, thus giving her plenty of contacts.”&nbsp; She generated a strong community base of volunteers, including the Junior Women’s League, and networked with donors in NYC and across the nation.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class="">She was a <strong>strong communicator</strong>, Julia effectively conveyed the mission of New Eyes to the media, and spoke about the many eyeglass recipients whose lives were changed by New Eyes.&nbsp;Her understanding of the value of public relations, and ability to use her connections in media - especially radio -  and in politics (Eleanor Roosevelt promoted New Eyes in interviews), elevated New Eyes’ profile globally.</p></li><li><p class="">Julia had a keen<strong> power of observation and strong sense of urgency. </strong>&nbsp;She was a woman of action, who quickly identified a public health challenge, created a unique business model and a movement.&nbsp; Seventeen years after New Eyes was founded,  Julia’s legacy still lived on, and continues to this day. <em>“Established without a doubt that ‘New Eyes’ can be a smoothly working organization, run in a business-like way, and capable of tackling any problem that arises,” said Isabel Hunt, New Eyes chair, in 1949. </em></p></li></ul><p class="">How would Julia react today, in a world facing a global pandemic, where the situation is drastically changing the way we live and work? As a leader who founded a nonprofit during the worst economic downturn in history, her priority would be to continue to serve those who needed eyeglasses.&nbsp; She would have faced disruption head-on, with confidence, and a plan in place. </p><p class="">For more information on Julia and the history of New Eyes, visit: <a href="https://new-eyes.org/our-history">https://new-eyes.org/our-history</a></p>]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/53628c55e4b038197f765c8d/1584990642881-46JE17MX4NGO1YOHZ9Z5/JuliaLawrenceTerry.jpg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="400" height="497"><media:title type="plain">Women Making History: Julia Lawrence Terry, New Eyes Founder&nbsp;</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Myth Busting</title><dc:creator>New Eyes</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 15 Feb 2021 15:25:03 +0000</pubDate><link>https://new-eyes.org/blog/mythbusting</link><guid isPermaLink="false">53628c55e4b038197f765c8d:5d8116ef505a1b02b25ed591:602a8d6e3a16522e1b991ebe</guid><description><![CDATA[&nbsp;

  <h2>Myth Busting: Why Many Americans are Denied Clear Vision</h2><p class="">Applicants to our U.S. eyeglass program come from all walks of life; many are working poor - meaning, they may have a job, yet still live below the federal poverty level or cost-of-living average.&nbsp; We have provided eyeglasses to senior citizens, single parents, children, veterans and families, who have no other alternative than New Eyes, for clear vision.</p><p class="">Some are even college students. “I’m a full time college student on a very low income,” says a New Eyes applicant.&nbsp; “Without these glasses, I won't be able to see my homework. My old glasses don't have bifocals. I'm a 4.0 student.”&nbsp;</p><p class="">What all of these groups have in common is that they face a daunting patchwork quilt of vision coverage, with each state offering different levels of vision and eyeglass coverage. The facts are startling:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class=""><strong>More than 80 percent</strong> of Americans don’t have vision insurance through their employer, leaving the working poor unable to afford eyeglasses (according to VSP, a vision insurer)&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Only 24 states </strong>offer Medicaid plans that include full eyeglasses coverage for their low-income residents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class=""><strong>The remaining 26 states</strong> offer <span><strong>no coverage</strong></span><strong> </strong>or limited Medicaid coverage for eyeglasses&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li></ul><p class=""><br>Moreover, senior citizens often face an uphill challenge when looking for resources to obtain eyeglasses.&nbsp; Traditional Medicare, covering more than 60 percent of Medicare enrollees, does not cover the cost of eyeglasses for seniors.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Since 1932, New Eyes has recognized the barriers in the U.S. that people face in getting eyeglasses and vision care.&nbsp; <strong>Be part of our movement</strong>, and visit us to learn more about how you can help:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Website: <a href="http://www.new-eyes.org"><span>www.new-eyes.org</span></a></p></li><li><p class="">Instagram: @neweyes_</p></li><li><p class="">Facebook: @neweyesfortheneedy <br></p></li></ul>

  <p class="">With the pandemic lockdown, New Eyes has been unable to rely on our usual corps of dedicated and engaged volunteers. They are key to accomplishing all we do to provide eyeglasses to so many in need. Without them, the piles of unopened used glasses packages grew and grew. Administrative tasks and project work went undone. </p><p class="">And New Eyes’ small staff was struggling to get through the workload on our own.   </p><p class="">What to do?&nbsp;  </p><p class="">Enter Ethan Tokar.  </p><p class="">Ethan, a new high school graduate, had volunteered intermittently the past three years at New Eyes when his schedule would permit (i.e. during baseball off-season and summer). This spring, mid-pandemic, Ethan emailed New Eyes to ask if he could volunteer after the school year was over. He had no extended plans for the summer before he headed off to college and was available to come in.   </p><p class="">Perfect! </p><p class="">The only downside was there was so much work to do, how could one young man do it all? We did not want to bring in another intern during the pandemic, concerned over potential coronavirus transmission.</p><p class="">Enter William Tokar.  </p><p class="">Will, Ethan’s younger brother, emailed us a few weeks later, indicating his interest in also working at New Eyes this summer.&nbsp; He had participated in the high school program last year. Could he be of help?  </p><p class="">Two brothers, quarantining together for months, who already knew and understood New Eyes’ mission? And literally live around the corner?   </p><p class="">Jackpot! </p><p class=""> It is no understatement when I say that Ethan and Will have been critical to New Eyes this summer. Here’s a short list of what they’ve done: </p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Freshly marketed New Eyes’ eBay store with promotions and marquee items and reorganized full inventory.</p></li><li><p class="">Uploaded new listings for sale on eBay store and New Eyes vintage eyeglass commerce site, researching, photographing, pricing and measuring donated frames, jewelry and gift ware.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class="">Eliminated the entire backlog of used glasses packages.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class="">Emailed used glasses donations acknowledgments.</p></li><li><p class="">Redeemed eyeglass recipient vouchers in our database.</p></li><li><p class="">Updated New Eyes’ website.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class="">Sorted and shipped donated hearing aids.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p></li><li><p class="">Created and scheduled New Eyes shipment of used glasses for use in developing countries.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class="">Cleaned and organized the sorting room.</p></li><li><p class="">Did complete inventory of type and number of used glasses   </p></li><li><p class="">Testing our new eyeglasses program software</p></li></ul><p class="">Ethan and Will have been a great help to New Eyes, but they also walk away with tangible work experience. They’ve gained and honed new skills during their summer here. The hard skills (like website development and marketing) and soft skills (of being “pushed out of their comfort zone” and learning “how to stay organized when there is a very complicated task presented”) will serve them well. &nbsp;(Those quotes are theirs!) </p><p class="">Aside from the amazing amount of work Ethan and Will have accomplished, it’s also been a pleasure getting to know these two young men. And entertaining when they act like the siblings they are (a shove here -oof!-, an insult there –“you’re such a loser’”). But there’s no doubt about the respect and affection they have for one another. It’s been fun to watch! &nbsp;  </p><p class="">Ethan, the aforementioned baseball player who was robbed of his last season of high school baseball, is headed to University of Rochester to study aerospace engineering among other subjects. His interests span the spectrum from sports, video games and working out to learning to code and watching videos about outer space.   </p><p class="">Will, who will be a high school junior in September, enjoys long hikes with family and friends, photography and soccer. He’s looking forward to (hopefully) attending school in person and being able to play again with his high school soccer team.   </p><p class="">Both have promised to return next summer when (we hope) things are back to normal.   </p><p class="">Like most nonprofits, the year 2020 has been a challenging one for New Eyes. But in one respect, we’ve been incredibly lucky.</p><p class=""> Thanks to a couple of brothers.  </p>]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/53628c55e4b038197f765c8d/1597686636114-UETUY91YM9IE0YGIXXHL/Tokar2.jpg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="640" height="480"><media:title type="plain">Interns to the Rescue!</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Grateful Series:&nbsp;Adams Dobbins, Nurse Practitioner </title><dc:creator>New Eyes for the Needy</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 27 May 2020 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://new-eyes.org/blog/may-27-2020</link><guid isPermaLink="false">53628c55e4b038197f765c8d:5d8116ef505a1b02b25ed591:5ecd428f29359c0004571dc6</guid><description><![CDATA[&nbsp;

  <h2><strong>Seeing 20 to 25 Patients a Day</strong></h2><h2><strong><em>Q &amp; A with Nurse Practioner, Adam Dobbins</em></strong></h2><p class=""><strong>What hospital do you work at, and where?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="">My primary work is full time at Truman Medical Center in Kansas City.&nbsp; This is a downtown safety net hospital, which means that we strive to serve all populations including minorities, the poor, the homeless, and those who cannot pay.&nbsp; I also work part time helping to cover ER shifts for small, rural hospitals that often have a difficult time staffing enough physicians and other providers to care for their patients...typically this work takes me to Iowa.</p><p class=""><strong>How do you describe your job?&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="">I am a nurse practitioner, certified in family practice and emergency medicine.&nbsp; I work ER, seeing patients of all ages with varying severity of illness/injury, assessing and diagnosing their problems, and developing a treatment plan for them which could include prescriptions medications or admission to the hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=""><strong>How many hours do you typically work in a shift?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="">My shifts are typically 12 hour shifts, though some of the rural shifts are 24 hour shifts.&nbsp; I will typically see 20-25 patients a day at Truman, and anywhere from a few, to as many as about 20 on the rural shifts.&nbsp;</p><p class=""><strong>Do you treat COVID-19 patients, or a mix of both?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="">A mixture of both.&nbsp; At Truman, we have tried to keep the potentially COVID patients isolated to one area so that we can have necessary protective measures at the ready and have a "cleaner" area for patients that may be more susceptible should they be exposed.&nbsp; At this time, I have rarely worked where patients with COVID symptoms are placed.</p><p class=""><strong>What do you wish people would have a better understanding of, given COVID-19? What do you want them to learn during this time, or be aware of?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="">Simpler methods of protecting yourself are likely the best.&nbsp; Hand washing/sanitizing and keeping surfaces clean are likely the best way to prevent the disease.&nbsp; Having hand sanitizing stations at each isle in the grocery store would likely be much more beneficial to preventing spread.&nbsp;</p><p class=""><strong>When you're outside of the hospital, what types of activities do you look forward to?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="">I enjoy working around the house and doing outdoor work.&nbsp; I enjoy camping, hiking, biking and spending time with my kids.&nbsp;</p><p class=""><strong>What part of your job do you enjoy the most? </strong>&nbsp;</p><p class="">Feeling like I can make a difference to someone.&nbsp; It may be a little thing, it may be a big thing...but sometimes they [my patients] really need me, and I hope I can come through. </p>]]></description><media:content type="image/png" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/53628c55e4b038197f765c8d/1590511112859-FJT7T038N8M6IXGOHBOS/Adam+and+family+1+USE.png?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1080" height="1080"><media:title type="plain">Grateful Series:&nbsp;Adams Dobbins, Nurse Practitioner</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Grateful Series:&nbsp;Charlotte Wescott </title><dc:creator>New Eyes for the Needy</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 19 May 2020 15:23:27 +0000</pubDate><link>https://new-eyes.org/blog/may-19-20</link><guid isPermaLink="false">53628c55e4b038197f765c8d:5d8116ef505a1b02b25ed591:5ec3f5748986ab6aa678969a</guid><description><![CDATA[&nbsp;

  <h2><strong>Why I Sew Masks&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p class="">Up until mid-March, I spent my days happily designing and knitting dog sweaters. Aran knit complicated sweaters for dogs and beautiful hand dyed wools in jewel tones for dogs. Then coronavirus hit the country, and I haven’t knit a stitch since. Seemed kind of lame to knit dog sweaters when people are dying from this virus and the medical teams don’t have enough protective gear to save themselves as they try to save the desperately ill. So I started sewing masks.</p><p class="">I am a sewer. Have been a sewer since I was a child. I learned to sew under the sewing machine table in my mother’s room. I would sit on the floor and work the foot presser with my hands as my mother would guide the fabric through the machine, telling me when to start and stop. She had incredible patience and sense of humor. And she taught me to sew and to love sewing. She made my clothes and then made matching outfits for my dolls. She taught me the value of scraps of fabric and how to turn them into quilts. If she were still here, she would be staying up all hours, too, making masks.</p><p class=""> My brilliant daughter and future son-in-law have pitched in, too. Marina is the artist in the family. But she can handle the rotary cutter and serger like a pro. Eric works the iron. We listen to music and make masks. </p><p class="">Last count, 1,020 masks have gone out the door. To hospitals, nursing homes, food banks and anyone who needs them. All I ask in return is that they stay healthy, be kind and pay it forward. And if they have any spare cotton fabric, elastic, or thread, please leave in the basket on my porch. And so I keep sewing.</p><p class=""><strong><em>Charlotte Wescott lives in West Orange, New Jersey.</em></strong></p>]]></description><media:content type="image/png" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/53628c55e4b038197f765c8d/1589901526870-JFVHR4UTQ73NF4TQXXVC/Blog+post+5-19-20.png?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="1767"><media:title type="plain">Grateful Series:&nbsp;Charlotte Wescott</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Grateful Series:&nbsp;Gilman Choudhury, COVID-19 Testing Site Volunteer</title><dc:creator>Gilman Choudhury</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 11 May 2020 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://new-eyes.org/blog/may-11-20</link><guid isPermaLink="false">53628c55e4b038197f765c8d:5d8116ef505a1b02b25ed591:5eb5cccb7752330cc3da26e4</guid><description><![CDATA[&nbsp;

  <h2><strong>The Saturday Routine&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p class="">Every Saturday, I volunteer at a COVID-19 testing site at William Paterson University in Wayne, NJ.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="">First, we decontaminate ourselves before we put on our personal protective equipment (PPE).&nbsp; We make sure to wash and clean any exposed skin.&nbsp; We are then checked for body temperature to ensure we're not sick. From there, we put on our equipment in pairs so our teammates can make sure that we're fully sealed up.&nbsp;</p><p class="">After we have our equipment on, we go to a briefing to hear about any new developments, a reiteration of safety protocols, and new procedures.&nbsp;</p><p class="">From there, we walk over to the location where we will test patients coming in. My teammate takes care of the paperwork, while I prepare to administer the test.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the paperwork is completed, and my test kit is ready, I begin to take the nasal swab. I hold the nasal swab inside the nasal cavity for about 10 seconds. After that, I remove the swab and put it in the test tube.&nbsp; My volunteer partner labels and seals the container.</p><p class="">&nbsp;We go back to the main tent to submit the sample, and decontaminate ourselves again before we see the next patient. We do this about 20 to 30 times throughout the three hour shift.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Once we complete our shift, we go down to the decontamination site to be fully cleaned and sprayed down before we can take off our PPE.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="">After we are observed decontaminating ourselves, we slowly take off one piece of equipment after another, until we're back to our normal clothing. We go back to the registration tent and get our temperature checked again. From there,&nbsp; we can sign out and go have lunch that is provided by restaurants which donate food.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Once I get to my car, I self-decontaminate again, to ensure I don't bring anything back home to my family. Then I decontaminate myself again before I get into the house and place all my medical clothing in a laundry bag outside my house. After an hour or two, I take the bag to the laundry to be cleaned using a special Lysol detergent.&nbsp;</p><p class="">That's my full routine whenever I volunteer on Saturday at the testing site.&nbsp;</p><p class=""><br>One of the biggest things I've learned, while volunteering at the testing site, is that during very difficult times, the best of humanity comes out. Even with great amounts of stress and fear, individuals step up to help those in need. The volunteers that risked their lives there, to the restaurants that donate meals to first responders, everyone is pulling above and beyond for each other.</p>

  <p class="">“Optics is in my DNA,” says Janet, as she carefully inspects a pair of eyeglasses, using a lensometer, a device used to determine the correct prescription of a pair of glasses.&nbsp; Volunteers buzz around Janet, during a busy Thursday morning (earlier this year) in the New Eyes sorting room, home to New Eyes’ global program.</p><p class="">Her father was an optometrist,<em> </em>and Janet started working alongside him while in high school.&nbsp; Under his mentorship, Janet decided to enter the optical profession and went on to work with her father for many years<em>.</em><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="">Now a semi-retired optician, Janet started volunteering for New Eyes last fall.&nbsp; “I was watching TV one Saturday and saw New Eyes featured on CBS New York,” says Janet. “ My husband and I thought it would be a great fit.&nbsp; So I called and asked, do you need any opticians to volunteer?”</p><p class="">Originally from Toronto, Janet has more than 35<strong> </strong>years of experience as an optician, helping adults and kids find eyeglasses that are the best match for them medically. &nbsp; She mentions that the New Eyes sorting process benefits from having an optician on-site, since the ability to fine-sort the eyeglasses in even greater detail enables those glasses to be put to good use much sooner.</p><p class="">As a volunteer, Janet uses her advanced optical skills to determine how to categorize eyeglasses donated to the New Eyes overseas program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="">“Each pair of glasses has a history,” says Janet, holding up sunglasses to the light.&nbsp; “Looks like a pair of sunglasses, right? Well, I can tell that it has a bifocal segment of a specific power.” Janet can even visualize the approximate age and locale of the prospective sunglass recipient overseas, based on her years of experience as an optician. “Perfect for a middle aged person in a hot climate.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="">She trains corporate volunteer groups on the ins and outs of sorting eyeglasses, and encourages them to place eyeglasses in the “Not Sure” bin, a category newly created by Janet.&nbsp; “It’s okay to be unsure,” says Janet. “And it builds volunteers’ self-confidence knowing that it’s alright not to always know.” There are so many different lenses that are difficult to identify, like digital progressive lenses, or ones with anti-reflective coating.&nbsp; New Eyes volunteers sort more than 15 categories of eyeglasses on any given day!&nbsp;</p><p class="">“These eyeglasses will transform someone’s life, and I’m proud to be a part of that,” says Janet.</p><p class="">Thank you Janet for your volunteerism and everything that you bring to New Eyes!&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="">Two years ago, when my husband and I down-sized from our family home in the New Jersey suburbs to Hoboken, a small city across the Hudson River from Manhattan, we certainly didn’t envision that we’d be spending weeks in self-isolation in an apartment during a pandemic.</p><p class="">I worked part-time at New Eyes as the Volunteer Manager and was thrilled to find that the reverse train commute to Short Hills three days a week was very doable, allowing me to continue working with the staff and volunteers that I love, and for a mission that changes lives.</p><p class="">In my job, I wear many hats and each day is different: Recruit and arrange training for new volunteers and groups. Help manage the global eyeglass distribution program, sorting, making/packing boxes, and sending shipments to missions that carry the glasses overseas.&nbsp; Answer email questions regarding collection drives and eyeglass donations. Work on the Ebay shop, selling/fulfilling glasses and jewelry to raise funds for our eyeglass voucher program. Assist our Fabulous Finds Resale Shop volunteers with marketing for their sales. Support volunteers with anything they need.</p><p class="">The week before New Jersey closed non-essential businesses, it became clear to us that decisions had to be made to protect our volunteers from the possibility of community spread. Every week, we have many groups of volunteers sorting/packing donated eyeglasses for global distribution, administration volunteers working on the eyeglass voucher program, groups with disabilities refining sorting skills, volunteers cleaning/pricing/selling donated jewelry in our Fabulous Finds Resale Shop, and high school students sorting glasses after school. </p><p class="">We were sanitizing, posting flyers to recent international travelers about quarantine, restocking hand soap and paper towels, and reminding people to wear gloves and to stay apart.&nbsp; Reality set in and we realized that we had to make the tough decision to close down the volunteer program and our Resale Shop until further notice. Many of our volunteers are seniors and our priority was keeping everyone safe. We were so touched when our Thursday sorters, a group that loves to chat and laugh, wanted to continue coming in!</p><p class="">&nbsp;To continue that strong feeling of community that we have at New Eyes, I emailed the volunteers and asked them to send greetings, thoughts, and updates for a weekly newsletter, New Eyes Strong. In our second issue this week, we had a 94th Birthday greeting to our wonderful Overseas Manager and 27-year volunteer, Jake Dalton. It has been uplifting to receive updates on what they are doing to keep sane, exercise tips, frustrating comments about the difficulty of booking grocery delivery, fun photos and jokes. The response has been very positive and I hope it brightens their day and makes everyone feel a little closer.</p><p class="">At my home “office” in Hoboken, we are in Week 3 of self-isolation, and it’s been a fairly smooth adjustment. My husband, college-aged son and I are each set up to work in a different room in the apartment. &nbsp;We purchased some emergency supplies a few weeks ago and are sanitizing hard surfaces. &nbsp;I’m waiting for empty elevators and walking the stairs for exercise. We are ordering groceries when we can and plan to go to a supermarket every two weeks…now with a mask. With a smaller refrigerator, we put extra vegetables and non-perishables on the balcony.&nbsp; I get out twice a day for a walk along the waterfront with my dog, enjoying the sunny days, the blooming trees and the tranquility of the water. </p><p class="">I look across the river at the city and think of those that are suffering and the dedication and sacrifices of our healthcare workers and first responders. I am so thankful for all of the brave men and women out there who are helping us, and will allow us, one day, get back to living our lives and helping others. </p><p class="">Sally Golding, Volunteer Manager</p>
